        <h2>üìñ Why I built this project</h2>
        <p className="pb-3">
          A few years ago I created the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com">R graph gallery</a>, a
          website providing hundreds of chart examples made with the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> programming language. Soon I
          created the equivalent for{" "}
          <a href="https://www.python-graph-gallery.com">python</a>,{" "}
          <a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com">d3.js</a> and{" "}
          <a href="https://www.react-graph-gallery.com">react</a>. Those
          websites are now used by thousands of people every day but only help
          for solving technical issues.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          This is why I created{" "}
          <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com">data-to-viz.com</a>, a
          classification of chart types based on the data input format. It
          describes the main chart types, explains in what situation they're
          useful and what are their main associated{" "}
          <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html">caveats</a>.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          Once you know what kind of chart to draw and how to make it,{" "}
          <b>one more crucial step</b> is missing on the pipeline: How do you
          make your viz original, insightful and beautiful?
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          This is when you start googling in the quest of inspiration, browsing
          the work of other people who faced the same challenged before.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          Being someone in love with data visualization for a while now, I've
          gathered my favorite snapshots in this portfolio and{" "}
          <TakeHome>
            hope it will make your life easier next time you have something
            awesome to build

        <h2>üíõ The best sources for great charts</h2>
        <p className="pb-3">
          The viz projects displayed in this gallery are coming from many
          different places, and I often discover them on{" "}
          <a href="https://twitter.com/R_Graph_Gallery">twitter</a>. It is
          nonetheless possible to group them in a few categories.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          <b>Newspaper</b> have became a continuous source of visuals, and it
          gets more true every day. Papers like the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">New York Time</a>, the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</a>, le{" "}
          <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr">Monde</a> or{" "}
          <a href="https://www.zeit.de/index">die Zeit</a> are constantly basing
          their studies on dataviz to better share the stories.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          Some <b>specialized magazines</b> even base their editorial line on
          dataviz. It is the case of{" "}
          <a href="https://pudding.cool">the Pudding</a> that explains ideas
          using visual essays. If you love scrolly telling don't go now! You
          will most likely loose your day if you do üòÄ.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          Dataviz <b>competition and challenges</b> are also some terrific
          source of nice visuals. I'm thinking for instance at the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com">
            information is beautiful award
          </a>{" "}
          or at the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">
            tidy tuesday
          </a>{" "}
          challenge where I got a lot of this website entries.
        </p>
        <p className="pb-3">
          But to be honnest what I really love is browsing the home page of{" "}
          <b>individual practitioners</b>. Watching the work of dataviz
          superstars like Nadieh{" "}
          <a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com">Bremer</a>, C√©dric{" "}
          <a href="https://www.cedricscherer.com">Scherer</a>, Maarten{" "}
          <a href="https://www.maartenlambrechts.com">Lambrechts</a>, Nathan{" "}
          <a href="https://flowingdata.com">Yau</a> and a myriad of other people
          is truely a hobby for me and it taught me so much both in term of
          dataviz and general knowledge.
